# Abstract

Here we present the Standard Container Integration Format (SCI-F), an organizational format for internally modular scientific containers that easily expose executables and metadata for discoverability and integration. With SCI-F, a single, reproducible container to deploy a published scientific workflow can have *multiple* exposed entry points, each that includes its own environment, metadata, installation steps, tests, files, and a primary executable script. We will start by reviewing the background and rationale for a container organizational format, and how SCI-F achieves the goals of **modularity**, **transparency**, and **consistency**. We then review the organizational structure of the standard, and the different levels of internal modules that it affords. For this work, we have implemented and released the format with the Singularity (Kurtzer et al.) software version 2.4, and discuss how a user would interact with a container generated with SCI-F. Finally, we discuss implemented use cases for SCI-F to evaluate container software, provide metrics, serve scientific workflows, and execute a primary function under different contexts. To encourage collaboration and sharing of apps, we have developed an open source, version controlled, tested, and programmatically accessible web infrastructure at <a href="http://containers-ftw.org/apps" target="_blank">http://containers-ftw.org/apps</a>. The ease of using SCI-F to develop scientific containers offers promise for scientists to easily generate self-documenting containers that are programmatically parseable, exposing software and associated metadata, environments, and files to be quickly found and used. In the following pages, we hope to show that:

SCI-F is useful because it allows for:

 - [flexible, internal modularity](/SCI-F/modules.html) where the definition of modularity is entirely based on the needs of the creator and user, and the resulting container reflects that.
 - [reproducible practices](/SCI-F/practices.html) by way of providing portable environments with modular internal contents that are easily discovered.
 - [integration with external tools](/SCI-F/tools.html) by way of programmatic accessibility to internal modules.
 - [predictable internal structure](/SCI-F/structure.html) that distinguishes scientific content from the operating system base.
 - [community resources](/SCI-F/community.html) including APIs, version control and testing, and open forums for tracking issue and discussion related to SCI-F and SCI-F apps.


We have provided several <a href="http://containers-ftw.org/apps/category/#Example" target="_blank">examples and tutorials</a> for getting started with SCI-F. If you have a workflow or container that you'd like to see added, please <a href="https://www.github.com/containers-ftw/apps/issues" target="_blank">reach out</a>. If you would like to see other ways to contribute, <a href="/SCI-F/community.html#contribute-to-sci-f">here are some suggestions</a>. This work will remain open for contributions, and early contributions will be represented in an official submission.
